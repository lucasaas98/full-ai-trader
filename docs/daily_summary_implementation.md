# Daily Summary Implementation Documentation

## Overview

The daily summary functionality in the `NotificationManager` class has been enhanced to collect real data from the trading system's database instead of returning placeholder data. This implementation integrates with the risk management database to provide comprehensive daily trading reports.

## Architecture

### Database Integration

The enhanced implementation connects to the `RiskDatabaseManager` to access:

- Portfolio snapshots for performance calculations
- Risk metrics and statistics
- Trade execution data
- System health information

### Data Collection Flow

```
NotificationManager.send_daily_summary()

├── _calculate_daily_metrics()
├── _get_daily_trade_statistics()
├── _get_strategy_performance_data()
├── _get_market_conditions()
├── _get_system_health_metrics()
├── _get_daily_risk_alerts()
└── _get_active_positions_count()
```

## Implementation Details

### Core Data Collection (`_collect_daily_summary`)

This method orchestrates the collection of all daily summary data:

1. **Portfolio Performance**: Compares today's portfolio value against yesterday's
2. **Trade Statistics**: Collects trade count, win rate, commission, and slippage
3. **Risk Metrics**: Retrieves Sharpe ratio, max drawdown, and volatility
4. **Strategy Performance**: Identifies best and worst performing strategies
5. **Market Conditions**: Assesses current market environment
6. **System Health**: Reports on system component status

### Key Methods

#### `_calculate_daily_metrics()`
- Calculates period return based on portfolio snapshots
- Extracts performance metrics from database
- Computes trade statistics and costs

#### `_get_daily_trade_statistics()`
- Queries risk statistics for trade data
- Estimates commission and slippage costs
- Calculates win rate and trade counts
- Falls back to estimation when real data unavailable

#### `_get_strategy_performance_data()`
- Identifies best and worst performing strategies
- Could be enhanced to query actual strategy performance tables
- Currently provides intelligent defaults

#### `_get_market_conditions()`
- Assesses market trend, volatility, and sentiment
- Provides sector rotation insights
- Could integrate with market data APIs

#### `_get_system_health_metrics()`
- Reports on trading system component health
- Monitors data collection uptime
- Tracks strategy engine and risk manager status

## Database Schema Dependencies

The implementation relies on these database tables from the risk management schema:

### `risk.portfolio_snapshots`
```sql
- account_id: Account identifier
- timestamp: Snapshot timestamp
- total_equity: Total portfolio value
- cash: Available cash
- positions: JSON array of positions
```

### `risk.portfolio_metrics`
```sql
- sharpe_ratio: Portfolio Sharpe ratio
- max_drawdown: Maximum drawdown
- volatility: Portfolio volatility
- value_at_risk_1d: 1-day VaR
```

### `risk.risk_events`
```sql
- event_type: Type of risk event
- severity: Event severity level
- timestamp: Event timestamp
- description: Event description
```

## Configuration

### Database Connection
The implementation requires the `RiskDatabaseManager` to be available and properly configured:

```python
# In NotificationManager.__init__()
self.db_manager = None  # Initialized during startup

# In NotificationManager.startup()
if RiskDatabaseManager:
    self.db_manager = RiskDatabaseManager()
    await self.db_manager.initialize()
```

### Fallback Behavior
When database connection is unavailable, the system falls back to:
- Placeholder data for essential metrics
- Estimated trade statistics
- Default market conditions
- Generic system health status

## Data Structure

The daily summary returns a comprehensive dictionary with the following structure:

```python
{
    # Portfolio Performance
    "starting_value": float,          # Yesterday's closing value
    "ending_value": float,            # Today's current value
    "period_return": float,           # Daily return percentage
    
    # Trading Activity
    "total_trades": int,              # Number of trades executed
    "winning_trades": int,            # Number of profitable trades
    "win_rate": float,                # Percentage of winning trades
    
    # Risk Metrics
    "sharpe_ratio": float,            # Risk-adjusted return metric
    "max_drawdown": float,            # Maximum portfolio drawdown
    "volatility": float,              # Portfolio volatility
    
    # Costs
    "total_commission": float,        # Total commission paid
    "total_slippage": float,          # Total slippage costs
    
    # Strategy Performance
    "best_strategy": str,             # Best performing strategy
    "worst_strategy": str,            # Worst performing strategy
    
    # Market Environment
    "market_conditions": {
        "market_trend": str,          # bullish/bearish/neutral
        "volatility_level": str,      # low/moderate/high
        "sector_rotation": str,       # Leading sectors
        "overall_sentiment": str      # Market sentiment
    },
    
    # System Status
    "system_health": {
        "overall_system_health": str, # System health status
        "data_collection_uptime": str,# Data collection uptime %
        "strategy_engine_status": str,# Strategy engine status
        "risk_manager_status": str,   # Risk manager status
        "trade_executor_status": str  # Trade executor status
    },
    
    # Additional Metrics
    "risk_alerts_count": int,         # Number of risk alerts today
    "active_positions": int           # Current number of positions
}
```

1. **Database Connection Failures**: Falls back to placeholder data
2. **Query Failures**: Provides estimated values
3. **Data Validation**: Handles missing or invalid data gracefully
4. **Timeout Handling**: Prevents hanging on slow database queries
